# Lattice Boltzmann Method
Here some simple codes for the Lattice Boltzmann Method are presented. Along with the codes I as well present some simple Python scripts to analyze results produced by those codes.

1. Shan-Chen gas-liquid model with the droplet in the center of a domain.

2. Binary-liquid free energy model with the droplet on the surface.

3. Shan-Chen gas-liquid model programmed on GPU with OpenCL technology.

4. Binary liquid model of the long gas bubbles in 3D microchannels (Bretherton flow). The implementation is parallelized in MPI. Two different implementations are covering full scale simulation and quarter channel simulations with symmetry conditions.
