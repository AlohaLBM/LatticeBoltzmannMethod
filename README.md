# LatticeBoltzmannMethod
Here some simple codes for the Lattice Boltzmann Method are presented. Along with the codes I as well present some simple Python scripts to analyze results produced by those codes.

1. Shan-Chen gas-liquid model with the droplet in the center of a domain.

2. Binary-liquid free energy model with the droplet on the surface.
